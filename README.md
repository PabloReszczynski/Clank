# CLANK

## A functional programming language inspired by Clojure and made in Rust.

The purpose of this project is to both learn Rust and make a language out of it
by designing an interpreter and compiler.
Also the objective is to use the minimum number of crates as possible, just to
get the hang of the language. Later some modules can be replaced with
external crates.

## (Non exhaustive) TODO (For an interpreter):
- [x] Make a simple scheme-inspired AST
- [ ] Make a lexer and parser.
- [ ] Make thread-safe persistent data structures:
  - [ ] Linked list
  - [ ] Array
  - [ ] Hash map
  - [ ] Set
  - [ ] FIFO Queue
